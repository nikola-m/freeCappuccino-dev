### A case of magnetohydrodynamic flow of a liquid - Hartmann problem

Source for the case:
https://www.openfoam.com/documentation/tutorial-guide/2-incompressible-flow/2.3-magnetohydrodynamic-flow-of-a-liquid

Hartmann number for the case is 20.

To make the comparison we use the same mesh and initial/boundary data. Only change we make is to introduce periodic boundary conditions in the streamwise direction.

Note:
freeCappuccino simulates Hartmann MHD flow using Electric potential formulation.

We have included the diagram with results of the validation in the case folder.
