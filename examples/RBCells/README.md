### Rayleigh-Bénard convection

The example is taken from OpenFOAM (www.openfoam.com) examples of heat transfer, more specifically from the examples for buoyantBoussinesqPimpleFoam solver.

OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-v2006/tutorials/heatTransfer/buoyantBoussinesqPimpleFoam/BenardCells

To run the case just unpack the archived files and execute run script in Linux terminal:

`./run`

Change input file in run script to try different algorithms PISO or SIMPLE. In the folder we have included prapared input files for both cases. Play with the parameters controling these two algorithms and observe are there any changes.

PLEASE NOTE: This video is made for old input file format. Now we use input files in the form of namelists which are a Fortran type of dictionary.
