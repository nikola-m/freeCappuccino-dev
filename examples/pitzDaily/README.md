### Backward facing step (Pitz&Daily experimental case)

This example is based on the pitzDaily example from OpenFOAM (v2006) tutorials. 

Mesh is generated by OpenFOAM mesh generator blockMesh. Here it is modified using 'readBoundaryFile' utility and manual editing.

freeCappuccino can read polyMesh format generated for OpenFOAM, after minor corrections to 'boundary' file.

To be able to write Paraview files, you need to have vtk template for this geometry - which is included here in the vtk folder. You would get it by opening original OpenFOAM case with paraFoam, and saving geometry as Paraview .vtm file. More about this in an onine tutorial.

To run this case do the following:

- Unpack zip archives with mesh (polyMesh.zip), vtk mesh file (vtk.zip), and initial and boundary conditions (0.zip).  

- Provided that you have cappuccino code on your path execute 'run' script from command line.  

- Open solution files located in vtk folder in Paraview.  

Change 'run' script to call different input file, eg. input-piso. Play with simulation case parameters (turbulence models, convection schemes, gradient approximations, under-relaxation parameters, number of SIMPLE iterations within timestep(maxit), etc.) to test different possibilities.
