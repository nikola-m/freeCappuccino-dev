### Transient heat conduction

An example of transient heat conduction in a solid.

The case is created on the basis of OpenFOAM tutorial case for laplacianFoam (source: https://www.openfoam.com/documentation/guides/latest/doc/guide-applications-solvers-basic-laplacianFoam.html)

Case files were converted using 'readBoundaryFile'. To simplify things for you we provide already prepared files.

In the case folder a gif file of temporal solution development is also provided.
