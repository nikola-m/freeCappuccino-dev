!
! This implementation fo PISO algorithm follows descripton given in
! Ferziger, Peric - Computational Methods for Fluid Dynamics, 2nd ed.
! It uses PRESSURE instead of PRESSURE CORRECTION as a variable.
! The same approach is also used in OpenFOAM library.
! The algorithm is summarised in following steps, with referenced eqns. 
! from the book given in braces: 
!
!  1) Ansemble and solve momentum eq. with pressure field from previous 
!     outer iteration or timestep (Eq. 7.30)
!     Obtained velocity doesn't satisfy continuity eqn.
!
!  2) Find "m* with tilde" velocities at each cell center (Eq. 7.31
!     but without the last term, i.e. the pressure gradient term)
!     ~ m*    ~ m*    ~ m*
!     u       v       w
!      P       P       P
!     "These are though as velocities from which the contribution of the 
!     pressure gradient has been removed"-Ferziger,Peric
!
!
!  3) Ansemble pressure equation (Eq. 7.35).
!     RHS is divergence of 
!         ~ m*        ~ m*         ~ m*
!     rho*u   ;   rho*v    ;   rho*w
!          P           P            P
!     Which means we interpolate these terms to cell face center, and 
!     dot them (perform scalar product) with cell face normal, i.e.
!     the face area vector.
!     Note, we don't need Rhie-Chow interpolation here. 
!     LHS matrix elements are divergence of unknown pressure gradient 
!     multiplied by rho/Ap, where Ap is diagonal term from momentum eq.
!     Note, divergence of gradient is Laplace operator, we can discretize
!     it in a routine that encapsulated implicit FVM calculation of  
!     Laplacian operator with rho/Ap as a coefficient.
!
!  4) Solve the system with tight tolerance (abs error below 1e-6 I guess)
!     to get new pressure field in cell centers.
!     Following that calculate new pressure gradients in cell centers.
!
!  5) Correct "m* with tilde" velocities to get velocities that satisfy
!     continuity equation (Eq. 7.34). 
!      m    ~ m*                             ~ m*      ~ m*
!     u   = u     - 1 / Apu * ( dp /dx)   ;  v   = ...  w = ...
!      P     P                                P          P
